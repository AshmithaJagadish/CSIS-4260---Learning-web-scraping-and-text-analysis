Gaza student protest leader held by US immigration agents,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdwy1gjjjo,"US President Donald Trump has said a leader of last year's Gaza war protests at Columbia University in New York City faces deportation after he was detained over the weekend. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents told Syrian-born Mahmoud Khalil they were revoking his student visa and green card when they took him into custody on Saturday, his attorney said. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the former student had ""led activities aligned to Hamas"", without providing details. The BBC has asked the agency for further information on the allegations. The Palestinian activist's lawyer, Amy Greer, said his detention was ""terrible and inexcusable"" and followed ""the US government's open repression of student activism and political speech"". Mr Khalil has not been charged so far with any crime. Mr Khalil was detained at his university-owned apartment in Manhattan and initially taken to an immigration holding facility in New Jersey after his arrest, according to ICE's online locator. His attorney said he is a legal permanent resident with a green card and married to an American citizen, who is eight months' pregnant. ICE agents also threatened to arrest Mr Khalil's wife, his attorney said. When his wife tried to visit Mr Khalil in New Jersey, she was told he was not there, according to his lawyer. The ICE online locator indicated on Monday that Mr Khalil was being detained at a facility in the town of Jena, Louisiana. In a post on social media on Monday, President Trump said Mr Khalil's arrest was the first of ""many to come"". He said any foreign students in the US who were found to be ""terrorist sympathizers"" would face deportation. Mr Khalil is the first known person to be detained as a part of Trump's pledges to crack down on those protesting over the war in Gaza. New York Attorney General Letitia James said on Monday she was ""extremely concerned"" about the arrest. ""My office is monitoring the situation, and we are in contact with his attorney,"" she said. Columbia said in a statement that law enforcement agents can enter university property if they produce a warrant. On Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted a news story on X about the arrest of Mr Khalil, commenting: ""We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported"". The Trump administration announced last week it was rescinding $400m (£310m) in federal grants to Columbia, accusing it of failing to fight antisemitism on campus. Columbia was the epicentre last year of pro-Palestinian student protests nationwide against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel. Mr Khalil was lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest when its protesters set up a huge tent encampment on the university lawn in protest against the Gaza war. Some students also took control of an academic building for several hours before police entered the campus to arrest more than 100 protesters. Mr Khalil was not in that group. He later told the BBC he had been temporarily suspended by the university, where he was a graduate student at the School of International and Public Affairs. Some Jewish students at Columbia have said that rhetoric at the demonstrations at times crossed the line into antisemitism. Other Jewish students on campus have joined the pro-Palestinian protests. Carly, a Jewish-American graduate student at Columbia and a friend of Mr Khalil, told the BBC that the detainee was a ""very, very caring soul"". ""He has been very targeted online and just seeing how he has been so misrepresented, it's very painful, as someone who knows him on a personal level,"" said Carly, who declined to share her surname for privacy reasons. Speaking on Fox News, Trump's border tsar Tom Homan alleged that Mr Khalil had violated the terms of his visa by ""locking down buildings and destroying property"". The Israeli military launched its campaign against Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack into Israel on 7 October 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage. More than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. With additional reporting from Nada Tawfik Nate Vance said his cousin and Trump were acting like 'useful idiots' to Putin The new district attorney's stand could roll back an effort by his predecessor to ease the brothers' punishment for killing their parents. Humanitarian organisations have warned that the end of USAID programmes is already impacting millions. BBC Russia editor Steve Rosenberg explores how Moscow has warmed to Trump's America.

Stocks slide as Trump warns of US economy 'transition',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz61nn99eg1o,"A sell-off in the US stock market gathered steam on Monday, fuelled by rising concern about the cost of the trade war to the world's largest economy. The S&P 500, which tracks the biggest American companies, fell about 2% in early trade, while the Dow Jones dropped 0.9% and the Nasdaq sank more than 3.5%. The falls came after President Donald Trump ducked questions about whether the US economy was facing a recession or price rises as a result of tariff moves, while warning instead of a ""period of transition"". Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, insisted there would be no contraction in the US, although he acknowledged that the price of some goods may rise. Investors fear that tariffs- which are taxes on goods applied as they enter the country -will lead to higher prices and ultimately dent growth in the world's largest economy. ""The level of tariffs that Trump is imposing, I think no doubt, will have to cause inflation somewhere down the line,"" Rachel Winter, investment manager at Killik & Co, told the Today programme. Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors had been optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war. He said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets. ""It's a complete change in what the market expected,"" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending amid the uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth. European stocks closed lower on Monday, with France's CAC and the London FTSE indices both closing around 0.9% lower. Germany's DAX closed 1.75% lower. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was because of ""unease around the impact of Trump tariffs"". She added that concerns over the US economy entering a recession is worrying investors. Tesla shares fell about 8% on Monday, while tech stocks Nvidia and Meta were both down more than 4%. Speaking to Fox News in an interview broadcast on Sunday but recorded on Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge the concerns, responding to a question about whether the US was facing recession: ""I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing."" ""It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,"" he added. The US president has accused China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations. He imposed new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada last week, but then exempted many of those goods just two days later. Trump also doubled a blanket tariff on goods from China to 20%. The US is now facing retaliation, including new tit-for-tat tariffs from China targeting US farm products that came into effect on Monday. They mean US exports including chicken, beef, pork, wheat, and soybeans face new tariffs of 10% to 15%. Ontario premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, also said he wasgoing forward with a 25% surchargeon energy exports to the US, announced in retaliation for the tariffs. If Trump escalates, ""I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,"" he warned. Speaking on NBC on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged: ""Foreign goods may get a little more expensive"". ""But American goods are going to get cheaper,"" he said. But when asked whether the US economy could face a recession he added: ""Absolutely not… There's going to be no recession in America."" Former US Commerce Department official, Frank Lavin, told the BBC that he thinks the trade war is unlikely to escalate out of control. But while tariffs will eventually ""fade a bit"" they will still be an ""extra burden on the US economy,"" he said. Han Shen Lin, China country director at consultancy firm The Asia Group, told the BBC's Today programme: ""You're seeing a lot of tit for tat between both sides to demonstrate that neither side will back off easily. ""That said China has realised it probably can't export its way to GDP growth in the way that it used to so it is focusing a lot more on the domestic economy right now."" The move is in retaliation to Trump's tariff threats on Canada, and is expected to raise energy costs for 1.5 million US homes. Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity affecting 1.5 million homes and businesses across Minnesota, Michigan and New York. The incoming Canadian PM has made standing up to his US counterpart a big part of his campaign. Justin Trudeau's party was headed for near-certain defeat - until the US president said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state. Across the country, Canadians are defiant in boycotting American goods and travel even as Trump promises another temporary reprieve. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Supreme Court will hear challenge to Colorado conversion therapy ban,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20417r234wo,"The US Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a challenge to a Colorado law that bans so-called conversion therapy. The justices agreed they will hear the case after a therapist from Colorado brought an appeal, arguing the state's restictions violate her free speech rights guaranteed under the US Constitution's first amendment. Conversion therapy - denounced by professional and health associations globally but promoted by some religious conservatives - aims to encourage lesbian, gay and transgender people to change their sexual orientation or gender identity. The highest court in the US previously turned away opportunities to rule on conversion therapy bans. More than 20 US states have banned conversion therapy for minors. Kaley Chiles, a licensed counsellor and practicing Christian in Colorado Springs, Colorado, claims the ban in her state interferes with her ability to treat individuals with ""same-sex attractions or gender identity confusion"" who ""prioritise their faith above their feelings"". Ms Chiles, who is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has said some of her patients seek out her counselling to resolve internal conflicts about their sexuality or gender identity. Colorado officials, however, have said the law does not regulate speech, it regulates conduct. They said if the courts side with Ms Chiles, it would ""undercut states' longstanding ability to protect patients and clients from harmful professional conduct"". ""A professional's treatment of her patients and clients is fundamentally different, for First Amendment purposes, from laypersons' interactions with each other,"" Colorado officials said. Ms Chiles sued over the Colorado law in 2022 and multiple lower level courts denied her request to pause the enforcement of the law. Last year, she appealed to the Supreme Court. A similar case, brought to the Supreme Court in 2023, was rejected but three of the court's conservative justices indicated they would have considered the case. Justice Samuel Alito said in his dissent that ""it is beyond dispute that these laws restrict speech, and all restrictions on speech merit careful scrutiny"". The Supreme Court will hear the case during their next term, set to begin in October. More than 1,300 practitioners across the US offer conversion therapy, according to a 2023 Trevor Project report. Critics of conversion therapy say it can be emotionally harmful, cause mental health issues and increase risk of suicide. Some practitioners rely on talk therapy or prayer, but extreme cases have subjected patients to physical violence and food deprivation. The American Medical Association rejects the idea that same-sex attraction or nonconforming gender identity are mental disorders, saying it is not supported by medical evidence. Nate Vance said his cousin and Trump were acting like 'useful idiots' to Putin The new district attorney's stand could roll back an effort by his predecessor to ease the brothers' punishment for killing their parents. US officials accused Mahmoud Khalil of activities ""aligned to Hamas"" but his lawyer said the government was attacking free speech.

Athol Fugard: Death of a great South African playwright,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j0rk1kl8no,"Athol Fugard, who has died aged 92, was widely acclaimed as one of South Africa's greatest playwrights. The son of an Afrikaner mother, he was best known for his politically charged plays challenging the racist system of apartheid. Paying tribute to Fugard, South Africa's Arts and Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie hailed him as ""a fearless storyteller who laid bare the harsh realities of apartheid through his plays"". ""We were cursed with apartheid, but blessed with great artists who shone a light on its impact and helped to guide us out of it. We owe a huge debt to this late, wonderful man,"" McKenzie added. Fugard wrote more than 30 plays in a career that spanned 70 years, making his mark with The Blood Knot in 1961. It was the first play in South Africa with a black and white actor - Fugard himself - performing in a front of a multiracial audience, before the apartheid regime  introduced laws prohibiting mixed casts and audiences. The Blood Knot catapulted Fugard onto the international stage - with the play shown in the US, and adapted for British television. The apartheid regime later confiscated his passport, but it strengthened Fugard's resolve to keep breaking racial barriers and exposing the injustices of apartheid. He went on to work with the Serpent Players, a group of black actors, and performed in black townships, despite harassment from the apartheid regime's security forces. Fugard's celebrated plays included Boesman and Lena, which looked at the difficult circumstances of a mixed-race couple. Having premiered in 1969, it was made into a film in 2000 starring Danny Glover and Angela Bassett. His novel, Tsotsi, was made into a film, winning the 2006 Oscar for best foreign language movie. The premier of South Africa's Western Cape province, Alan Winde, said that Fugard had a ""penetrating, sharp wit"", and his ""acute understanding of our country's political and cultural make-up is unmatched"". ""He will be sorely missed,"" Winde added. Other well-known plays by him include Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island, which he co-wrote with the actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona, in a powerful condemnation of life on Robben Island, where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. In a simple tribute on X, Kani posted: ""I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend Athol Fugard. May his soul rest in eternal peace. Elder 🌹"" Fugard won several awards for his work, and received a lifetime achievement honour at the prestigious Tony awards in 2011, while Time magazine described him in the 1985 as the greatest active playwright in the English-speaking world. ""Apartheid defined me, that is true... But I am proud of the work that came out of it, that carries my name,"" Fugard told the AFP news agency in 1995. Fugard feared that the end of apartheid in 1994 could leave him with little to do, but he still found enough material to write. In a BBC interview in 2010, he said that he shared the view of the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu that ""we have lost our way"" as a nation. ""I think the present society in South Africa needs the vigilance of writers, every bit as much as the old one did. ""It is a responsibility that young writers, playwrights, must really wake up to and understand that responsibility is theirs, just as it was mine and a host of other writers in the earlier years.""

A simple guide to Canada's federal election,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydlr3reqpo,"Mark Carney is due to be sworn in as Canada's next prime minister in the coming days, having won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau. It means he will lead the governing Liberal Party of Canada in the next election -  which is expected to be called soon. Several political leaders had called for a vote after Trudeau announced he was resigning as leader of the Liberals in January. But after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on the country, potentially sparking a trade war, opposition parties have suggested Canada should vote as soon as possible. By law, the maximum time between federal elections in Canada is five years. The next vote is officially scheduled for 20 October 2025. However, there are a couple of scenarios in which an early election can be triggered: When Trudeau resigned in January, he suspended parliament so that the Liberal Party, which currently controls government, could have a leadership race to find his replacement. Carney, announced as Trudeau's replacement on Sunday, could call an election early. Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, has already said he will call for a vote of no confidence once parliament returns, as has Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party. In the Canadian federal election - as in the UK's general election - voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister. Instead, it is the leader of the party with the majority of members of parliament (MPs) who becomes PM. That means Carney will be in the running, along with Poilievre and Singh. Four main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois. The Liberals have been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. They currently hold 153 seats. The Conservatives are the official opposition with 120 seats. The Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, has 33 seats, and the NDP has 24. The Green Party hold two seats. During the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead. But the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down. Trump has since taken office in the US and introduced steep tariffs against Canada, which has raised expectations of a closer vote. WhenTrudeau resigned at the beginning of this year, he did so under significant pressure from his own party - it was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the party's hopes of winning the next election. National polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), show how support for the Liberals waned throughout 2023 and 2024. At the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January of this year - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%. Since then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that 40.4% of Canadians back the Conservatives, while 30.8% support the Liberals. In the process of regaining some support, the Liberals have attempted to draw comparisons between Poilievre and Trump in the aftermath of the US president introducing 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports to the country. After being announced as Trudeau's successor, Carney said regarding the trade war that  ""Americans should make no mistake... Canada will win"". There are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons. All the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election. Members of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election. Like the UK, Canada has a ""first-past-the-post"" electoral system. The candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area. The leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs will normally form the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition. If no party ends up with a majority seats - the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government. Practically, it means the party will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties. To vote in a Canadian election,  someone must be a Canadian citizen, at least 18 years old, and have proof of identity and address. Copyright 2025 BBC.

'We go from dinner service to dealing with a corpse': What happens when an air passenger dies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9nj075yggo,"If a passenger dies on board a flight, cabin crew members like Jay Robert have to think fast. ""We go from service to lifesaving to mortician, dealing with dead bodies and then doing crowd control,"" the 40-year-old says. ""We're having to calculate: 'Okay, we still need to serve 300 people breakfast or dinner and we have to deal with this'."" Jay, a cabin manager for a major European airline and a former crew member for Emirates, has more than a decade's experience working on planes. Like all cabin crew, he has been trained to deal with passenger deaths, but has only experienced one himself. He says deaths on planes are ""very uncommon"" and that people are more likely to die on longer flights because of the physical toll of being immobile for a long period. Some flight crew don't experience an on-board fatality during their entire career, he says. Astudypublished in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013 concluded that dying on a flight was ""rare"". The study, which looked at emergency calls from five airlines to a medical communications centre between January 2008 and October 2010, found that 0.3% of patients who had an in-flight medical emergency died. Last month, an Australian couple spoke about their ""traumatic"" experience ofsitting next to a bodyon a plane from Melbourne to Doha after a woman died during the flight. Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin said cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him. Qatar Airways said it followed appropriate guidelines and apologised for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"". BBC News has spoken to cabin crew and other aviation experts about how mid-air deaths are usually handled, what the rules are around storing corpses on planes and what it's like to work on a flight when someone has died. Flight crew themselves can't certify a death - this has to be done by medical personnel. Sometimes, this happens on the plane if there's someone qualified on board but more often, it is done upon landing. Most airlines follow the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) guidelines on what to do if a passenger has been presumed dead, though policies vary slightly by airline. In a medical emergency, cabin crew would administer first aid and seek help from any passengers who were medical professionals, while the captain would use a telecommunications system to get instructions from emergency doctors on the ground, says Marco Chan, a former commercial pilot and a senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University. If necessary, the captain would divert the flight as soon as possible. But it's not always possible to save a passenger. If a passenger is presumed dead, the person's eyes should be closed and they should be placed in a body bag, if available, or otherwise, covered with a blanket up to the neck, according to the IATA guidelines. Planes have very limited space, and it's a challenge to find a suitable spot to place the body without disturbing other passengers and compromising the plane's safety. Per the IATA, the body should be moved to a seat away from other passengers or to another area of the plane, if possible. But if the plane is full, they would usually be returned to their own seat. In a narrow-body plane - those typically used for short-haul flights across the UK or within Europe - there isn't enough room on board ""to really shield a passenger from what has happened"", says Ivan Stevenson, associate professor in aviation management at Coventry University. Space on these planes is ""very, very confined"", he says. ""If someone dies on board an aircraft like that, it's quite likely they will need to be placed in a seat."" Prof Stevenson acknowledges it's ""very unfortunate, very unpleasant"" but that crew have to put the plane's safety first. Crew will ""try to give some decency to the dead body"" by placing it on an empty aisle and using curtains, blankets and dim lights, Jay says, but they might not have much choice. The body can't be placed in the galley in case it blocks an emergency exit. It also can't be left in the aisles in case there is an emergency evacuation, Jay says, or placed in the crew rest area on a long-haul flight. It's also hard to physically manoeuvre a body in such a confined space, Jay says. This is what happened in the Qatar Airways case, when Mr Ring said the deceased passenger couldn't be carried down the aisle. A plane would divert to save a passenger's life in the event of a medical emergency - but it usually wouldn't if they were already presumed dead, aviation experts and cabin crew say. There's ""no point diverting"", Mr Chan says. The captain would inform both the airline's operations centre and air traffic control of the passenger's death as soon as possible, and the plane would be met by local authorities, Prof Stevenson says. Either local authorities or a representative from the airline would contact the passenger's family if they were flying alone. Ally Murphy, who hosts the Red Eye Podcast where she interviews flight attendants, experienced one passenger death during a flight in her 14 years working as cabin crew. A male passenger who had been travelling alone from Accra, Ghana, to London passed out in his seat. After being alerted by the passenger in the seat next to him, the crew realised he wasn't breathing normally and didn't have a pulse. The crew moved the man to the galley to perform CPR. ""You're kind of trapped in a tin can that's not designed for roaming around,"" Ally recalls. But there was more space than usual in the galley because the carts were out for meal service. Ally and another crew member performed CPR for 40 minutes without success. The captain then decided to divert the plane to Lyon, France, and though Ally and her colleague knew they should have strapped themselves in for landing, they continued performing CPR the whole time, she says. ""We didn't want to leave him."" After landing, paramedics took the passenger away. He was declared dead, having suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm, Ally recalls. ""I held him in my arms for the final moments of his life,"" she says. ""He probably would have chosen someone else for that, but he got me."" After the plane set off again following the diversion, the passengers were ""quite quiet and sombre,"" she says. But on arrival at their destination airport, one passenger from the flight started shouting at her because he missed his connecting flight. ""That's the one and only time that I've ever told a passenger where to go,"" she says. Witnessing a passenger dying was a traumatic experience for Ally. ""I went home and sat in the bath and I cried. I could taste the man's breath for about a week afterwards,"" she says. ""It was a little traumatising for a while. I couldn't watch anything with CPR for a long time."" Cabin crew are offered support after a passenger dies, including therapy and the option to have their rosters cleared for a few days so they can process what has happened, Jay says. Ally and her colleagues had a debrief with her airline after the passenger died where they were given ""reassurances that we did everything that we could"".

Rubio says Ukraine partial ceasefire plan 'has promise' ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4gldd5ljo,"America's top diplomat has said that he sees promise in Ukraine's proposal for a partial ceasefire to end the three-year war with Russia, ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia between US and Ukrainian officials. ""I'm not saying that alone is enough but it's the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end the conflict,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Monday. Kyiv is expected to propose an aerial and naval truce with Russia during the negotiations on Tuesday, a Ukrainian official told AFP. Russia has previously rejected the idea of a temporary ceasefire, saying it was an attempt to buy time and prevent Ukraine's military collapse. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky landed in Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although he is not expected to play any formal role in the talks between his country and the US. The Ukrainian team will be represented by Zelensky's head of office Andriy Yermak, the country's national security adviser and several foreign and defence ministers. Rubio will represent the US delegation alongside National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Before arriving in Jeddah on Monday, Rubio said that it was important to ""establish clearly Ukraine's intentions"" for a peace deal and that the country would ""have to be prepared to do difficult things like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things to end this"". ""I'm not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do,"" he added. ""We want to listen to see how far they're willing to go, and compare that to what the Russians want, and then see how far apart we truly are."" He said that both sides needed to realise that ""there's no military solution"" to the conflict and it can only be resolved through ""diplomatic means"". It comes as Donald Trump steps up pressure on Zelensky to agree to a ceasefire with Moscow, without any promises of US security guarantees. The talks mark the first official meeting since Zelensky's visit to the White House descended into acrimony last month. Following the meeting, the US paused military aid and intelligence sharing for Kyiv in an apparent bid to get Zelensky to the negotiating table. Rubio said that he hoped the pause in aid could be ""resolved"" but that the negotiations on Tuesday ""would be key to that"". The suspension ""came about because we felt that they [Ukraine] were not committed to any sort of peace process"", he said, and ""if that changes, obviously our posture can change"". ""The President is going to use whatever tools he has at his disposal to try to get both sides to that table so this war will end,"" he added. Earlier on Monday, Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected ""substantial progress"" during the negotiations. Asked whether he thought Zelensky would return to the US to sign a minerals deal later in the week, he told Fox News: ""I am really hopeful. All the signs are very, very positive."" Zelensky has previously said he is willing to sign a minerals deal with the US, which would establish a joint fund from the sale of Ukrainian minerals. Witkoff said that among the issues to be discussed in Saudi Arabia were security protocols for the Ukrainians and territorial issues. He said the US administration had never shut off intelligence sharing for anything defensive that Ukraine needed, while on Sunday Trump told Fox News that he had ""just about"" lifted the intelligence sharing pause on Ukraine. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also spoke to Trump ahead of the talks, Downing Street said. ""The Prime Minister said he hoped there would be a positive outcome to the talks that would enable US aid and intelligence-sharing to be restarted,"" the spokeswoman said. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and currently holds around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, including Crimea which it annexed in 2014. The three went back and forth in an exchange of posts on X over Starlink being cut off in Ukraine. How are Russia and Ukraine placed after three years of fighting and with Donald Trump suggesting talks on ending the war could begin soon? Russia hoped to overthrow Ukraine's pro-Western government in days, but it failed. Cameron Thomas was in the RAF before becoming an MP last year, and recently returned from Ukraine.

Policeman convicted for viral torture video found dead in jail,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20py1lvz8o,"A former Thai police chief who was jailed for life three years ago for torturing a drug suspect to death has been found dead in his Bangkok jail cell, authorities said. Thitisan Utthanaphon, who was nicknamed Joe Ferrari for his many luxury cars, died by suicide, according to a preliminary autopsy. In 2021, a leaked video showed Thitisan and his colleagues wrapping plastic bags around the head of a 24-year-old drug suspect during an interrogation, leading to the suspect's death. The video sparked national outrage at that time over police brutality in Thailand. It has made fresh rounds on social media in the wake of Thitisan's death. Thailand's justice ministry has launched an investigation into his death after his family expressed doubts that he killed himself. Further tests were needed to confirm that he had indeed died in a suicide, authorities said. Justice minister Tawee Sodsong said on Monday that all evidence related to Thitisan's death should be disclosed, and urged prison authorities to cooperate with investigators. The family said Thitisan was previously assaulted by a prison staffer. They said officials did not allow them to see his body, which was found in his cell on Friday. But on Sunday authorities said ""no prison officer or inmate has harmed or caused [his] death"". A previous raid on Thitisan's house revealed that he owned a dozen luxury sportscars. Authorities believe he owned at least 42, one of them a rare Lamborghini Aventador Anniversario, of which only 100 were made, priced in Thailand at 47 million baht ($1.45m; £1.05m). As a police colonel, Thitisan was paid about $1,000 a month. There were allegations that he demanded bribes from the suspect in the viral video, Jirapong Thanapat, while suffocating him. Thitisan denied this. Thitisan surrendered in 2021 following a manhunt. Besides Thitisan, five other police officers were convicted of murdering Jirapong and were also sentenced to life in prison in 2022. ""It's like he has paid off the karma he committed,"" Jirapong's father said in an interview on local media on Saturday. The Department of Corrections said they had been investigating a previous complaint filed by Thitisan's family alleging that he had been bullied and assaulted by prison officers earlier this year. Thitisan had consulted doctors over anxiety issues and trouble sleeping, the department said. His family visited him on the day that he died and prison staff did not notice any ""abnormalities"", it said.

North Korean hackers cash out hundreds of millions from $1.5bn ByBit hack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kgndwwd7lo,"Hackers thought to be working for the North Korean regime have successfully converted at least $300m (£232m) of their record-breaking $1.5bn crypto heist to unrecoverable funds. The criminals, known as Lazarus Group, swiped the huge haul of digital tokens in a hack on crypto exchange ByBittwo weeks ago. Since then, it's been a cat-and-mouse game to track and block the hackers from successfully converting the crypto into usable cash. Experts say the infamous hacking team is working nearly 24 hours a day - potentially funnelling the money into the regime's military development. ""Every minute matters for the hackers who are trying to confuse the money trail and they are extremely sophisticated in what they're doing,"" says Dr Tom Robinson, co-founder of crypto investigators Elliptic. Out of all the criminal actors involved in crypto currency, North Korea is the best at laundering crypto, Dr Robinson says. ""I imagine they have an entire room of people doing this using automated tools and years of experience. We can also see from their activity that they only take a few hours break each day, possibly working in shifts to get the crypto turned into cash."" Elliptic's analysis tallies with ByBit, which says that 20% of the funds have now ""gone dark"", meaning it is unlikely to ever be recovered. The US and allies accuse the North Koreans of carrying out dozens of hacks in recent years to fund the regime's military and nuclear development. On 21 February the criminals hacked one of ByBit's suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address that 401,000 Ethereum crypto coins were being sent to. ByBit thought it was transferring the funds to its own digital wallet, but instead sent it all to the hackers. Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been  taken. The firm has since replenished the stolen coins with loans from investors, but is, in Zhou's words, ""waging war on Lazarus"". ByBit's Lazarus Bounty programme is encouraging members of the public to trace the stolen funds and get them frozen where possible. All crypto transactions are displayed on a public blockchain, so it's possible to track the money as it's moved around by the Lazarus Group. If the hackers try to use a mainstream crypto service to attempt to turn the coins into normal money like dollars, the crypto coins can be frozen by the company if they think they are linked to crime. So far 20 people have shared more than $4m in rewards for successfully identifying $40m of the stolen money and alerting crypto firms to block transfers. But experts are downbeat about the chances of the rest of the funds being recoverable, given the North Korean expertise in hacking and laundering the money. ""North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering and they don't care about the negative impression of cyber crime,"" Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point said. Another problem is that not all crypto companies are as willing to help as others. Crypto exchange eXch is being accused by ByBit and others of not stopping the criminals cashing out. More than $90m has been successfully funnelled through this exchange. But over email the elusive owner of eXch - Johann Roberts - disputed that. He admits they didn't initially stop the funds, as his company is in a long-running dispute with ByBit, and he says his team wasn't sure the coins were definitely from the hack. He says he is now co-operating, but argues that mainstream companies that identify crypto customers are betraying the private and anonymous benefits of crypto currency. North Korea has never admitted being behind the Lazarus Group, but is thought to be the only country in the world using its hacking powers for financial gain. Previously the Lazarus Group hackers targeted banks, but have in the last five years specialised in attacking cryptocurrency companies. The industry is less well protected with fewer mechanisms in place to stop them laundering the funds. Recent hacks linked to North Korea include: In 2020, the US added North Koreans accused of being part of the Lazarus Group to its Cyber Most Wanted list. But the chances of the individuals ever being arrested are extremely slim unless they leave their country. The reserve will hold cryptocurrency forfeited to the government in criminal or civil proceedings, said the White House. The Justice Department said Chinese agencies paid as much as $75,000  (£58,200) for each hacked email inbox. Tourists were finally allowed into North Korea last month, but the excitement has been short-lived.

'There's never been a spotlight like this': Greenland heads to the polls as Trump eyes territory,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4236e2wz2o,"Residents of Greenland head to the polls on Tuesday in a vote that in previous years has drawn little outside attention - but which may prove pivotal for the Arctic territory's future. US President Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland has put it firmly in the spotlight and fuelled the longstanding debate on the island's future ties with Copenhagen. ""There's never been a spotlight like this on Greenland before,"" says Nauja Bianco, a Danish-Greenlandic policy expert on the Arctic. Greenland has been controlled by Denmark – nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away – for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. Now, five out of six parties on the ballot favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about. The debate over independence has been ""put on steroids by Trump"", says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq. The island's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught the US president's eye. He first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in 2019. Since taking office again in January, he has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory. Greenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands. Addressing the US Congress last week, however, Trump again doubled down. ""We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,"" he said, prompting applause and laughter from a number of politicians, including Vice-President JD Vance. In Nuuk, his words struck a nerve with politicians who were quick to condemn them. ""We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,"" Prime Minister Mute Egede said. Still, the US interest has stoked calls for Greenland to break away from Denmark, with much of the debate focused on when – not if – the process of independence should begin. Greenland's independence goal is not new, Nauja Bianco points out, and has been decades in the making. A string of revelations about past mistreatment of Inuit people by the Danes have hurt Greenlandic public opinion about Denmark. Earlier this year, PM Egede said the territory should free itself from ""the shackles of colonialism"". But it is the first time the subject has taken centre stage in an election. Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), the party of Prime Minister Mute Egede, favours gradual steps towards autonomy. ""Citizens must feel secure,"" he told local media. Arctic expert Martin Breum says Egede's handling of the challenge from Trump and strong words against Denmark over past colonial wrongdoings ""will give him a lot of votes"". Smaller rivals could also gain ground and potentially shake up alliances. Opposition party Naleraq wants to immediately kick-off divorce proceedings from Copenhagen and have closer defence dealings with Washington. Pointing to Greenland's EU departure and Brexit, party leader Pele Broberg has said that Greenland could be ""out of the Danish kingdom in three years"". Naleraq is fielding the largest number of candidates and has gained momentum by riding the wave of discontent with Denmark. ""Naleraq will also be a larger factor too in parliament,"" predicts Mr Breum, who says party candidates have performed well on TV and on social media. However, the centre-right Demokraatit party believes it is too soon to push for independence. ""The economy will have to be much stronger than it is today,"" party candidate Justus Hansen told Reuters. Greenland's economy is driven by fishing, and government spending relies on annual subsidies from Denmark. Talk of Trump and independence has overshadowed other key issues for voters, says newspaper editor Masaana Egede. ""It's an election where we should be talking about healthcare, care of the elderly and social problems. Almost everything is about independence."" According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back moves towards future statehood. About 44,000 people are eligible to vote, and given the low numbers and few polls, results are difficult to forecast. Even though a majority of Greenlanders favour independence,a survey has shownthat half would be less enthusiastic about independence if that meant lower living standards. One poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish to become a part of the United States, and nearly half see Trump's interest as a threat. One fear among some Greenlanders, says Masaana Egede, is how long the Arctic island could remain independent and whether it would break off from Denmark only to have another country ""standing on our coasts and start taking over"". Experts say it is this worry that could steer votes towards keeping the status quo. Although Greenland's right to self-determination is enshrined into law by the 2009 Self-Rule Act, there are several steps to take before the territory could break away from Denmark, including holding a referendum. This means getting full independence could take ""about 10 to 15 years,"" says Kaj Kleist, a veteran Greenlandic politician and civil servant who prepared the Self-Rule Act. ""There is lot of preparation and negotiations with the Danish government before you can make that a reality,"" he adds. Whatever the election's outcome, experts do not believe Greenland could become independent before Trump's second term is over in 2028. The results are expected in the early hours of Wednesday.

Ontario premier: Tariffs could add $100 to US electricity bills,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cjw29e0xge9o,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced his own tariffs in response to US President Donald Trump's tariffs against Canada. Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity exports that will affect 1.5 million homes and businesses across Minnesota, Michigan and New York. Ford said he does not want to do this but ""will not hesitate"" to increase the charge or to shut off the electricity all together. Some say the US tariffs have unified their country, with others pledging to fully avoid American products.

Musk says X hit by 'cyber-attack' as thousands report outages,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62x5k44rl0o,"Elon Musk says X (formerly Twitter) has been hit by a ""massive cyber-attack"" on Monday, after thousands of users in the UK and US reported outages. Mr Musk, who has owned the platform since late 2022, suggested the attack may be ongoing. ""We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources,"" hewrote in a post on X. He suggested that ""either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved"". The BBC has approached X for comment. It comes after platform outage monitor Downdetector said it had seen tens of thousands of reports from US users of technical issues affecting the platform on Monday. There were more than 8,000 outage reports from UK users shortly before 14:00 GMT, following a brief but notable surge of reports on Monday morning. Many users trying to access the platform and refresh feeds on its app and desktop site during Monday's outages were met with a loading icon. Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said its own metrics suggested the outages could well be linked to a cyber-attack. ""What we've been seeing is consistent with what we've seen in past denial of service attacks, rather than a configuration or coding error in the platform,"" he told BBC News. He said the organisation has seen several major outages spanning more than six hours on Monday, ""each having global impact"". ""This is amongst the longest X/Twitter outages we've tracked in terms of duration, and the pattern is consistent with a denial of service attack targeting X's infrastructure at scale,"" he added. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to take a website offline by overwhelming it with internet traffic. Mr Musk has previously claimed that the platform has been targeted by DDoS attacks,but these have not been confirmed. The billionaire boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is a controversial figure. The Today programme presenter said his login details were stolen after he clicked a link in a fraudulent email. Contrary to posts on his X account, the Today presenter reveals he is not launching a new cryptocurrency. Vice-President JD Vance had said the young employee should be given a second chance.

Visa rule warning as tourist detained at US border,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80y3yx1jdyo,"A Welsh woman has spoken about being held in ""horrendous"" conditions after she was accused of ""violating"" her visa and was stopped at the US border. Becky Burke, 28, has spent 11 days in a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing centre in Washington State and was also denied entry into Canada, over a ""visa mix-up"". Her father, Paul Burke, has urged travellers to be ""very careful"" about their visa requirements. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Burke said: ""They keep saying in all their booklets that this is not a prison. It's hard to distinguish from my conception of a prison."" US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it could not comment on specific cases for privacy reasons, but added: ""All persons arriving at a port-of-entry to the United States are subject to inspection. ""CBP officers treat all travellers with integrity, respect, professionalism and according to law. ""In the event a foreign national is found inadmissible to the United States, CBP will provide the foreign national an opportunity to procure travel to his or her home country. ""If the foreign national is unable to do so, he or she will be turned over to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) for repatriation."" The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) confirmed it was supporting a British national. Ms Burke, an artist from Portskewett, Monmouthshire, began backpacking around the US on 7 January. She had flown from New York to Portland, Oregon, where she spent time with a host family, helping with household chores in return for accommodation. At the end of February she travelled to Seattle with plans to travel to Vancouver in Canada to stay with another family. However, when she reached the border, Mr Burke said the Canadian authorities denied her entry as they were concerned she may try to work illegally. She described how she spent six hours at the border, waiting while officials were ""trying to determine if what I had been doing in America counted as work"". She said she was ""interrogated"" and, despite explaining she was ""not paid at all"", it was decided she had ""violated"" her visa. Ms Burke said she was being held in a dormitory of 110 people in a ""maxed out"" immigration detention centre in Tacoma, Washington. ""They wake us up at 6:30am. There is never enough time to sleep. It's so cold,"" she said. ""I wear the same jumper for a week. They're short or out of stuff, like blankets and extra clothes. I have one towel."" She added many of the people she had met were ""stuck"" at the centre, separated from their families - in some cases, for years. ""Everyone is actually really shocked when I explain my situation,"" she added. ""I came to the US for the first time two years ago... I had a great time, that's why I wanted to come back again. I love nature and hiking. Now I see no nature in here at all."" Immigration experts tell the BBC that once Ms Burke informed Canadian officials of her plans and they denied her entry, a suspension of her visa waiver and detention on the US side was probably unavoidable. Many countries strictly interpret what constitutes compensated work - even if no money changes hands. And under the best of circumstances, processing within by the US immigration system can move slowly. Circumstances are far from usual in the US at the moment, however. The Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement across the US, so these experts caution that anyone entering the country should be careful to ensure that all their documents are in order and that they are clear about their intentions upon entering the country. American immigration policy and enforcement is changing under the new administration, and there is less tolerance for even seemingly honest mistakes. Such advice comes too late for Ms Burke, who is currently caught in a bureaucratic limbo. She's trying to stay detached from this, trying to see this as an experience to talk to the people in there and share their stories as well. It's an unusual circumstance - she says she is unlike most of the more than 100 detainees in her building in Tacoma - many of whom have been held for months or even years. She wants to travel back to her home in the UK as soon as possible, while others she speaks to, from places like Mexico, Brazil and Russia, have family in the US and are unwilling or unable to return to their home nations. According to the experts, we probably won't have any advance notice of when she is allowed to get on a plane and leave. It could happen, and her family find out about it after the fact. Ms Burke's dad described the situation as a misunderstanding of her accommodation arrangements, which were ""just like a cultural exchange"". He said Ms Burke got free accommodation for helping host families ""around the house"", which he believes authorities may have suspected broke the terms of her tourist visa. Mr Burke toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfasthe could not understand why his daughter was ""locked up and she's in an orange prison jumpsuit whilst the paperwork gets sorted out"". He said what was meant to be a life-changing backpacking trip ""has turned into a nightmare"". He added: ""At first she was just distraught. She was inconsolable. She is allowed to ring out using a shared iPad but we can't call her."" The dad said, as their family is not American, they cannot add money to Ms Burke's inmate account for her to buy essentials, so they have reached out to some American friends to help. Mr Burke said his daughter just wants to come home and has asked for voluntary departure but it has been ""radio silence"". The family have been told voluntary departure has to be approved by a judge, but added they do not know ""how to make that happen"". Ms Burke's parents said they were in daily contact with the British consulate in San Francisco, which is the nearest one to the detention facility, but claimed ""official channels can't get a clear answer about what is going on"". Melissa Chavin, a US immigration lawyer based in London, said Ms Burke could be released either through voluntary departure or expedited removal, but the process of appearing in front of a judge as part of voluntary departure could be delayed because several dozen of the approximately 700 immigration judges had resigned or been fired by the Trump administration. Trump won the US presidential election last November after promising to strengthen US borders and rigorously enforce immigration law. Ms Chavin said expedited removal – which allows officials to quickly deport non citizens – had been expanded under President Trump and could now happen anywhere in the country as opposed to within 100 miles of the border. ""That could work out well for [Ms Burke] – in that she could leave quicker,"" Ms Chavin said, adding that it would also come with a five-year ban on travelling to the United States. She also urged people travelling to the United States to ensure they can pay for their own accommodation. Ms Burke said she planned the trip before Trump's presidency, but was ""cautious"" and aware she would need to prove that she did not intend to stay in the country. She added she was ""lucky"" compared to some people who were fighting to remain in the country, and were ""stuck between a rock and a hard place"". ""Everyone's story is really sad. No one deserves to be in here. Everyone detained here is so nice,"" she said. Ms Burke had organised some of her trip through Workaway, which matches hosts with travellers. A spokesperson for the company said it was ""very sad"" to hear about what had happened but that it was ""the responsibility of the host and person travelling to make sure they are within the law, have the correct visa or permit and insurance in place before travelling"". ""Unfortunately if these warning are not followed and someone attempts to enter the United States without the correct permissions or visas in place then the US border control are within their rights to refuse entry."" Ms Burke's family have been in touch with Monmouthshire MP Catherine Fookes, who has raised the case with Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty. ""I am deeply concerned about my constituent's welfare and the distress this situation is causing her and her family,"" said Ms Fookes.

Girls in England lag behind boys in maths and science study,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w0l414rv4o,"A gender gap has opened up between boys and girls in maths and science subjects in England, a new report suggests. The international study, carried out every four years and published by the Department for Education, found that the gap between boys and girls in Year 5 and Year 9 was significantly larger than in previous versions of the study. The gap in Year 9 maths in England was wider than in any other country taking part in the study, with boys scoring 26 points higher than girls.In 2020, the gap was two points. Schools Minister Catherine McKinnell said the government will continue to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects, ""especially among girls"". The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), was carried out by researchers at University College London (UCL). The latest report uses data gathered in 2023. In science, Year 9 boys in the study were 14 points ahead of girls. In the previous report, published in 2020 using 2019 data, girls scored three points higher than boys. Jennie Golding, a co-author of the report from the Institute of Education at UCL, believes issues around confidence and a sense of belonging could be possible reasons why girls' performance has suffered. But she said more research was needed to understand and address it, with boys and girls getting similar TIMSS scores in previous studies. Mary Richardson, the report's other co-author, said: ""It is possible that some of the effects of Covid, learning loss and changes to learning environments are now revealing themselves."" This is the first time the assessment has been fully digital, which may have had an impact on scores, researchers said. A gender gap has opened up in favour of boys since the last report in comparative countries too, such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In England, the gap is much closer when looking at Year 6 Sats results for 2024, where girls continued to outperform boys at the expected standard in all subjects apart from maths, where boys outperformed girls by one percentage point. It is a similar story for older age groups doing their GCSEs and A-levels, where boys tend to outperform girls in maths and science but to a lesser degree than in the latest TIMSS study. Part of the TIMSS study also found that more boys reported feeling ""very confident"" in maths than girls. Tanya Tracey, chief executive of the charity Girls Are Investors, said many of the girls and young women they support have a fear of failure and lack confidence. The charity tries to encourage more women and girls to pursue careers in the male-dominated investing sector, through mentorship and workshops. ""Part of the job is knowing you won't get it right all the time - that's a surprise to many girls I think. They always think they have to be perfect,"" she added. The government said it would be looking at how to ensure all children get a strong foundation in maths through its curriculum and assessment review. The schools minister said it was important to ""break the link between background and success so every child can achieve and thrive"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

What we know about the North Sea tanker collision,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z9ee68y6o,"More than 30 people have been rescued following a collision between an oil tanker and a cargo vessel in the North Sea off the coast of East Yorkshire. An emergency response has been ongoing since around 10:00 GMT on Monday and one vessel is believed to be leaking fuel into the sea. Here is what we know so far. The Stena Immaculate is a US-flagged oil and chemical tanker, which was on its way to Hull after departing from a Greek port, according to ship tracking site MarineTraffic. The Solong is a Portuguese-flagged container vessel with capacity to carry 9,500 tonnes of cargo. It had been making its way south from the Scottish port of Grangemouth to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Photos and videos from the scene showed large clouds of smoke billowing out from the oil tanker, and the company which manages the Stena Immaculate has reported ""multiple explosions"". The Stena Immaculate was carrying jet fuel - which, a US official confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, was being transported on behalf of the American military. The US maintains several military facilities in the UK. Crowley, the company which manages the vessel, confirmed that fuel had been released into the sea, though HM Coastguard said the extent of any pollution was still being assessed. Jet fuel has a high boiling point, meaning it will evaporate slowly and is relatively toxic. Marine life that comes into contact with it may be killed. This type of fuel can be broken down in the water by bacteria and it appears from images some of it has already caught fire and been burnt off. The Solong was carrying 15 containers of sodium cyanide among its cargo, according to a report from maritime data provider Lloyd's List Intelligence. Dr Mark Hartl, associate professor of marine biology at Herriot Watt University, said sodium cyanide is very soluble in water and can be toxic because it interferes with the respiration of animals, but at this point it is not clear if any has entered the water. Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at Leeds University, said there is a risk that some hydrogen cyanide gas might have been produced if the sodium cyanide came into contact with water. If this happened, the hydrogen cyanide ""could present a risk to any of those involved in rescue"", Prof Hay added. Dr Hartl said marine creatures have a major avoidance reaction so may have already vacated the affected area. Marine ecology and conservation expert Dr Tom Webb said the chemical pollution resulting from incidents like this one ""can directly impact birds, and it can also have long-lasting effects on the marine food webs that support them"". Data from tracking site MarineTraffic appears to indicate that one ship was moving and the other was nearly stationary when the collision happened. The Stena Immaculate was drifting at a speed of 0.1 knots at 09:48 GMT. The Solong approached from the north at a speed of 16 knots. Crowley said the Stena Immaculate was struck by the Solong while it was anchored. It said its cargo tank carrying jet fuel was ruptured in the crash, causing a fire and the release of fuel. However, it is still unclear what caused the cargo ship to strike the oil tanker. We still do not know precisely how many people were on board, how many were injured or to what extent. No fatalities have been confirmed. Local MP Graham Stuart said he had been informed that one person was in hospital, but the other 36 mariners across both crews were safe and accounted for, although that has not been confirmed by the authorities. The chief executive of the Port of Grimsby earlier said that 32 people had been brought ashore. The firm which operates the Stena Immaculate said its crew of more than 20 had all been brought to safety. It is not known precisely how many people were on the Solong. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Ontario says it will slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrpnr6kr2o,"Canada's most populous province Ontario is slapping a retaliatory 25% surcharge on electricity it sends to US states in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods. Ontario leader Doug Ford confirmed the move in a news conference on Monday morning, saying it will increase costs about $10 (£7.75) per megawatt-hour for US customers. Roughly 1.5 million American homes in the northern border states of New York, Michigan and Minnesota will be impacted. Ford said that the surcharge on energy will remain until the threat of tariffs from the US ""is gone for good."" ""President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,"" Ford said in a statement on Monday. He added that Ontario will be using the revenue from its retaliatory tariffs on energy to support local workers and businesses impacted by US tariffs on Canada. Canada's federal government has also imposed its own dollar-for-dollar reciprocal tariffs on $30bn worth of US goods exported north. The list of products impacted ranges from clothing to perfume to orange juice. President Trump has threatened Canada repeatedly with a blanket 25% tariff on all Canadian exports to the US - a move that economists have warned could result in job losses in Canada while increasing prices for Americans. The US has threatened similar tariffs on neighbouring Mexico as well. Last week, Trump imposed the levies but quickly reversed course, saying he would temporarily spare carmakers from tariffs until 2 April. He later carved out further exemptions on goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) agreement, which Trump signed in his first term. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%. Trump, however, is still expected to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium some time this week. The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence. The S&P 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, has plunged to its lowest point since September, after Trump imposed the tariffs last week and later declined to rule out the possibility of a recession. In a Fox News interview that was taped on Thursday, Trump said ""I hate to predict things like that"" in response to the possibility of a severe economic downturn, after saying that the tariffs could bring about a ""period of transition."" ""It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,"" Trump said. Nate Vance said his cousin and Trump were acting like 'useful idiots' to Putin Humanitarian organisations have warned that the end of USAID programmes is already impacting millions.

Musk and Rubio spar with Polish minister over Starlink in Ukraine,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87vg38dnpo,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk have clashed with Poland's foreign minister over the use of the tech billionaire's Starlink satellite internet system in Ukraine. Musk said on X that Ukraine's ""entire front line"" would collapse if he turned the system off. Radoslaw Sikorski responded, saying his country paid for its use in Ukraine and a threat to shut it down would result in a search for another network. Rubio dismissed Sikorski's claims and told him to be grateful, while Musk called him a ""small man"". The exchange appeared to lead to Polish PM Donald Tusk calling on his country's allies to show respect for their weaker partners, rather than arrogance. Starlink's system is part of SpaceX's venture to provide high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas. It has been used extensively by the Ukrainian military. Sunday's exchange started when Musk posted that Starlink was the ""backbone of the Ukrainian army"" and that ""their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off"". Sikorski then responded, saying that Poland was paying for the service. ""Starlinks for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year,"" Sikorski wrote. ""The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers."" In response, Rubio said Sikorski was ""just making things up... no-one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink"". ""And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,"" he added. Musk later responded to Sikorski's post calling him a ""small man"". ""Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink,"" he wrote. On Monday morning Polish Prime Minister Tusk, without specifying who or what he was referring to, wrote on X: ""True leadership means respect for partners and allies. ""Even for the smaller and weaker ones. Never arrogance. Dear friends, think about it."" The Starlink terminals are key to Ukraine's army operations and have been used since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022. There are tens of thousands of terminals in the country, including up to 500 bought by the US Department of Defence in June 2023. Starlink is one of, if not the most, reliable means of communication for Ukrainian troops. It is used for reconnaissance drones, which stream troops real-time battlefield data that allows for quick reactions to attacks. This compensates for Ukraine's disadvantages in manpower, as the military does not need to keep large numbers of soldiers along the entire defensive line. Drone footage also helps to direct artillery fire and identify targets for kamikaze drones. Requesting evacuation or providing the exact location of a target would also be much slower and more complicated without Starlink, as regular radio stations may be out of range, jammed or compromised.

How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3911lv1pzko,"The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump. Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013. He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job. But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month. Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories. The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University. In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister. In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis. Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England. In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority. He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor. In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions. Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of ""forward guidance"", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%. Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an ""unreliable boyfriend"", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down. Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums. In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound. Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession. In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal. He described it as his ""toughest day"" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively. The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy. His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock ""should be temporary"". Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour. From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency. He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage. He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change. His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea. ""Why don't I become a circus clown?"" he told a reporter in 2012. Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation. Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post. Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods. ""I know how to manage crises,"" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. ""In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills."" Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board. They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister. The move is in retaliation to Trump's tariff threats on Canada, and is expected to raise energy costs for 1.5 million US homes. Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity affecting 1.5 million homes and businesses across Minnesota, Michigan and New York. Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister and Liberal Party leader. Mark Carney says threats from Washington threaten Canada's way of live. Canada could hold a national election soon, just as politicians and voters are focused on a trade war with its neighbour, the US. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Former US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin had made clear their mutual dislike for one another.

People on both sides of the conflict have shared their anxieties as gears grow that the fighting could resume. Hamas took 251 people hostage in the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent looks at what is behind Hamas announcing a delay to new hostage releases. The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war follows 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. The first phase of the deal between Israel and Hamas has expired, and its future is now in doubt. The US president sparked a social media frenzy when he posted a video of Gaza generated by artificial intelligence on his site Truth Social. In 2008, Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert urged the Palestinian leader to agree to a two-state solution. The map he drew has never been revealed to media - until now.

Luxury lounges: Credit card perks 'we are all paying for',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yen4k1xnko,"I'm standing in what feels like a suite in a posh hotel - all soft lighting, marble counter tops, plush seating and parquet-style flooring. An ornate platter of food catches the corner of my eye. ""That is a seafood tower as a welcome food amenity, as well as caviar, and you can also see the champagne there for guests to enjoy,"" says Dana Pouwels, head of airport lounge benefits at US bank Chase. She is showing me around Chase's new Sapphire Lounge at New York's La Guardia Airport. This is what waiting to catch a flight can look like these days – if you can afford to pay $550 (£433) a year to have the correct credit card required to gain entry. Then once inside Chase's new La Guardia lounge you can then choose to pay up to $3,000 to access a private suite for a few hours. It is all part of what has been described as a global arms race among the credit card companies that you are probably entirely unaware of – they are competing to outdo each other with bigger, better, bolder airport lounges. And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap. ""Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,"" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. ""From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge. ""Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen."" Airport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access. But now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too. JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business. For American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan. Its Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars. It's designed for Centurion card holders – a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one. ""We're more than a credit card company or a charge card company, it's more a lifestyle brand, getting you special access to concerts, getting you into restaurants,"" says Audrey Hendley, the head of global travel at American Express. The card issuers have even moved into a 21st Century staple, the coffee shop. Capital One have Capital One Cafés - now you have a barista in a bank. Their branch in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC has all the classic signs of the hip coffee shop - exposed vents, bare brick walls, barista coffee machine. The only immediate giveaway you might be in the bank is the neon Capital One sign on the wall and their branded touch screens. Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs. Anyone can use the café, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew. ""We're creating a showroom for our products,"" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes. ""For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for."" None of this sounds like the sort of language you hear normally hear from financial institutions. Dan Bennett is the head of behavioural science the ad giant Ogilvy. He says this is all about brands tapping into how people think about themselves, and other people. ""Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,"" he says. ""It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated. ""The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that. ""And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens."" But even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work. He points out that credit cards aremore expensivefor merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee. Prof Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards. ""We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,"" he explains. ""If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers. Well-off people get to use the high merchant fee, high reward cards, and then it's the rest of society that has to bear that cost."" Whoever is picking up the cost, the direction of travel is clear. More lounges and lifestyle experiences are coming as card issuers compete against each other. The arms race to get your credit card loyalty isn't slowing down. Investors are nervous about the possibility of a US recession, say experts. The NHS is looking into claims that a software flaw at Medefer left patient data vulnerable.

Musk's Tesla facilities in US face 'Takedown' protests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvze9dzq8vo,"Tesla facilities across the US are facing protests and vandalism in response to the political role Elon Musk, who owns the car manufacturer, has played in the Trump administration. Most ""Tesla Takedown"" protests have been peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week. That was followed by six arrests in New York over the weekend when hundreds of protesters occupied a Tesla showroom. There has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk. One woman showed up to a protest outside a Burbank Tesla on Sunday with an expletive and Musk's name scrawled in chalk across her white Model X sedan. Another car carried an ""Anti Elon Tesla Club"" sticker. The protests illustrate a growing unease over Musk's influence on the US government since President Donald Trump allowed him to create the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). So far, Doge has fired or offered buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees and gained access to the sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans. Critics have resorted to calling the tech billionaire ""President Musk"", arguing that he has too much power in the White House. Some at the protest in Burbank held signs that said ""Deport Elon"" and ""Boycott Swasticar"" - with protesters attempting to connect the car to fascism. Tesla produced the must-have electric cars for many Americans with progressive views, but several protesters said they regretted their purchase after Musk involved himself with Trump and US politics. Karen Rabwin, a protester at the Burbank Tesla on Sunday, attended just two days after trading in her Tesla for a Cadillac. She had slapped a bumper sticker on her old vehicle that read ""Bought This Car Before We Knew"" in a veiled reference to Musk, but she felt that wasn't enough. ""It was embarrassing,"" she said of driving the Tesla. ""It wasn't what I stood for. How could I drive that car? I have principles."" Singer Sheryl Crow donated her Tesla to National Public Radio last month. She posted a video to Instagram waving goodbye to the car as it was towed away. ""There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,"" Ms Crow wrote. Musk has responded to the protests by sharing a video on X - the social media platform he owns - of a Cybertruck customer in Texas marvelling at the vehicle's full self-driving mode. ""Heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices,"" Musk wrote. The social media platform has many posts of Tesla owners showcasing their electric cars. But there are also now videos showing a growing trend of Cybertrucks vandalized with swastikas, used as skate ramps or covered in garbage. During Mardi Gras in New Orleans, spectators booed an orange Cybertruck and pelted it with beads, calling the futuristic looking vehicle a ""Deplorean"" or other unfriendly monikers. Protesters on Sunday said they want to take down Telsa's value because they are concerned that Mr Musk is damaging the economy and the the country - and their efforts may be having an effect. While Tesla's share price surged after Trump was elected - with Musk by his side on election night in Florida - they have tumbled back to pre-election levels following the  backlash to Musk's political involvement. Some on Sunday also raised concerns that Musk's government involvement is benefiting his businesses. Critics note that the tech entrepeneur's companies have billions of dollar of contracts with the US government, primarily with Nasa and the Defense Department, which are increasingly reliant on Musk's SpaceX for satellite launches and space exploration. Last week, reports claimed the Musk had attempted to get the Federal Aviation Administration to cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to revamp the agency's telecommunications system and awarding it to Starlink, a company owned by SpaceX, instead. SpaceX denied that report, posting on X that ""Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to 'take over' any existing contract"". Some constituents are furious at Musk's involvement and the White House's effort to cut certain jobs and programmes. Many have shown up at Republican town halls to protest the cuts and the tech billionaire's growing influence. House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders urged members of their party to stop hosting events in response, claiming without evidence that they were being disrupted by ""professional protesters"". Nate Vance said his cousin and Trump were acting like 'useful idiots' to Putin The new district attorney's stand could roll back an effort by his predecessor to ease the brothers' punishment for killing their parents. US officials accused Mahmoud Khalil of activities ""aligned to Hamas"" but his lawyer said the government was attacking free speech.

More than 80% of USAID programmes 'officially ending',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx2401vn5ro,"The vast majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes have been terminated after a six-week purge, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced. On X, Rubio said that the initiatives ""spent tens of billions in ways that did not serve"" or harmed US interests. The remaining programmes - just 18% - will now be administered by the State Department. Humanitarian organisations around the world have warned that the controversial move to end long-running US aid programmes is already having dire consequences around the world, potentially endangering lives. The Trump administration has repeatedly made clear that it wants overseas spending to be closely aligned with its ""America First"" approach. Shortly after Trump returned to the White House on 20 January, thousands of USAID employees were put on leave, and those working overseas recalled. In an executive order signed on his first day, Trump also moved to freeze foreign assistance funding and ordered a review of USAID's work abroad, led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. Thousands of development contracts also were cancelled, and thousands of employees ultimately fired. In his X post, Rubio said that after the review, the US was ""officially ending"" about 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programmes. ""In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programmes we are keeping....to be administered more effectively under the State Department,"" Rubio added. Additionally, Rubio thanked Doge and State Department staff ""who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform"". Democrats and various humanitarian organisations have characterised the shutdown of USAID's programmes - which were funded by Congress - as illegal, prompting several lawsuits. USAID was tasked with a wide variety of missions around the globe, ranging from famine detection to polio vaccinations and emergency food kitchens in conflict zones. The freezes in funding and elimination of programmes is already having an impact. In Sudan, for example, the freeze in humanitarian assistancehas led to the shuttering of over 1,100 communal kitchensset up to help those left destitute by the country's ongoing civil war. It is estimated that almost two million people have been affected. In Oman, dozens of Afghan women who fled the Taliban government to pursue higher educationnow face return after their USAID-funded scholarships were abruptly terminated. In another example, India's first medical clinic for transgender peopleshut operations in three citiesafter US President Donald Trump stopped foreign aid to it. The new district attorney's stand could roll back an effort by his predecessor to ease the brothers' punishment for killing their parents. US officials accused Mahmoud Khalil of activities ""aligned to Hamas"" but his lawyer said the government was attacking free speech.

Not so demure any more: The rise of 'free the nipple' fashion,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp06n0d8eo,"Six months ago,a viral TikTok trendmade us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks. At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, promptinghundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom. She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. ""I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,"" she said. ""I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?"" The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress. The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo. At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath. Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show. Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too. As Vogue wrote in January: ""For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season."" Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes. Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as ""demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes"". The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing ""a strappy white top with no bra"". Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again. The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The ""free the nipple"" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014. Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. ""Stop policing women's bodies,"" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so ""why is society judging?"" But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance. ""Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,"" one person wrote on social media. Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a ""provocative statement"", but says it's a ""way to reclaim the right to govern one's body"". The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds. Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend ""is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion"". The idea of freeing the nipple ""isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms"", he argues. ""Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers."" It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars. Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though. At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty. There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress. ""This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,""the New York Times noted. However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote thatshe's over the trendbecause ""it's only women who do this"". ""It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,"" she wrote. Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timothée Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit. It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention. A chiffon dress worn by the late Queen Elizabeth and a ball gown worn by her sister are on show. Amelie Rule, 21, says her own shopping experience inspired her clothing business. Vera Wang tells Katty Kay how she shifted from being a Vogue fashion editor to the world's most beloved wedding dress designer. How much attention did you pay to what has been going on in the world over the past seven days? More than 800 complaints were made to the media watchdog, mainly about Carpenter and Charli XCX.

US unveils new app for 'self-deportations',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7430kq7eyxo,"The Trump administration is repurposing a mobile application -  originally created to facilitate asylum appointments - into a way for undocumented migrants already in the US to ""self-deport"". The app, known as CBP Home, allows migrants to submit an ""intent to depart"", which US Customs and Border Patrol says offers them a chance to leave without ""harsher consequences"". US officials have repeatedly suggested that undocumented migrants in the country should leave voluntarily, rather than be arrested and subject to deportation. This is the latest move in the White House's effortto dramatically overhaul the US immigration system, which has included promises of mass detentions. Originally launched as CBP One in 2020, the mobile application was expanded during the Biden administration to allow prospective migrants to book appointments to appear at a port of entry. At the time, officials credited the application with helping reduce detentions at the border and portrayed the technology as part of a larger effort to protect asylum seekers making the often dangerous journey. Now, on the newly rebranded application, undocumented migrants identify themselves and declare their intention to leave the country. In a statement quoted by Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that by self-deporting through the app, migrants ""may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream"". ""If they don't, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return,"" she added. The app also asks migrants whether they have ""enough money to depart the United States"" and whether they have a ""valid, unexpired passport from your original country of citizenship"". The BBC has contacted DHS for further details about how the process works once the forms on the app are filled out. CBP Home can also be used to apply and pay for I-94 entry and exit cards up to seven days before travel, book inspections for perishable cargo and check wait times at US border crossings. The Trump administration moved quickly to scrap the CBP One app as part of a larger shift in immigration strategy. It also paused parole programmes, and an uptick in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the country followed. In late February, the administration saidit wouldcreate a national registry for undocumented migrantsand those failing to sign up could possibly face criminal prosecution. The registration requires any undocumented migrants above the age of 14 to provide the US government an address and their fingerprints. Experts said that the registration system will face hurdles, as it is difficult to enforce and fraught with logistical challenges.

The 'anti-Trump' numbers man who may force the UK to take a side,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80y3m249z3o,"Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the ""anti-Trump"" on the US president's doorstep. The former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought ""dark days"" from ""a country we can no longer trust"" and that he was ""proud"" of Canadians resisting the US ""with their wallets"". While on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs ""until Americans show us respect"", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking. Trump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. ""The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our country… Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,"" he said. Behind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to""stand up to a bully"". He ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused ""entirely"" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and ""perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back"". He follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over. Carney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic. He has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund. Carney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said ""good luck with that"". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's ""southern neighbour"". The Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June. His rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely. On the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards ""more reliable"" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US. The bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system. He says Canada can ""stand on its own feet"" but sees merit in creating a more coherent international alliance to focus the minds of Congress and tariff-sceptics in the Trump administration. Canada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear. Canada and the UK should be on the same side in this new world era. Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister and Liberal Party leader. Mark Carney says threats from Washington threaten Canada's way of live. Canada could hold a national election soon, just as politicians and voters are focused on a trade war with its neighbour, the US. The 59-year-old political newcomer says he will keep tariffs on US imports ""until the Americans show us respect"". Canada's next PM, who described the US as a ""country we can no longer trust"", will need to work with the US president. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Summer is early - and India's economy is not ready for it,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrnyde158po,"A shorter winter has literally left Nitin Goel out in the cold. For 50 years, his family's clothing business in India's northwestern textile city of Ludhiana has made jackets, sweaters and sweatshirts. But with the early onset of summer this year, the company is staring at a washout season and having to shift gears. ""We've had to start making t-shirts instead of sweaters as the winter is getting shorter with each passing year. Our sales have halved in the last five years and are down a further 10% during this season,"" Goel told the BBC. ""The only recent exception to this was Covid, when temperatures dropped significantly."" Across India as cool weather beats a hasty retreat, anxieties are building up at farms and factories, with cropping patterns and business plans getting upended. Data from the Indian Meteorological Department shows that last month was India's hottest February in 125 years. The weekly average minimum temperature was also above normal by 1-3C in many parts of the country. Above-normal maximum temperatures and heatwaves are likely to persist over most parts of the country between March and May, the weather agency has warned. For small business owners like Goel, such erratic weather has meant much more than just slowing sales. His whole business model, practised and perfected over decades, has had to change. Goel's company supplies clothes to multi-brand outlets across India. And they are no longer paying him on delivery, he says, instead adopting a ""sale or return"" model where consignments not sold are returned to the company, entirely transferring the risk to the manufacturer. He has also had to offer bigger discounts and incentives to his clients this year. ""Big retailers haven't picked up goods despite confirmed orders,"" says Goel, adding that some small businesses in his town have had to shut shop as a result. Nearly 1,200 miles away in Devgad town on India's western coast, the heat has wreaked havoc on India's much-loved Alphonso mango orchards. ""Production this year would be only around 30% of the normal yield,"" said Vidyadhar Joshi, a farmer who owns 1,500 trees. The sweet, fleshy and richly aromatic Alphonso is a prized export from the region, but yields across the districts of Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, where the variety is predominantly grown, are lower, according to Joshi. ""We might make losses this year,"" Joshi adds, because he has had to spend more than usual on irrigation and fertilisers in a bid to salvage the crop. According to him, many other farmers in the area were even sending labourers, who come from Nepal to work in the orchards, back home because there wasn't enough to do. Scorching heat is also threatening winter staples such as wheat, chickpea and rapeseed. While the country's agriculture minister has dismissed concerns about poor yields and predicted that India will have a bumper wheat harvest this year, independent experts are less hopeful. Heatwaves in 2022 lowered yields by 15-25% and ""similar trends could follow this year"", says Abhishek Jain of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (Ceew) think tank. India - the world's second largest wheat producer - will have to rely on expensive imports in the event of such disruptions. And its protracted ban on exports, announced in 2022, may continue for even longer. Economists are also worried about the impact of rising temperatures on availability of water for agriculture. Reservoir levels in northern India have already dropped to 28% of capacity, down from 37% last year, according to Ceew. This could affect fruit and vegetable yields and the dairy sector, which has already experienced a decline in milk production of up to 15% in some parts of the country. ""These things have the potential to push inflation up and reverse the 4% target that the central bank has been talking about,"" says Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist with Bank of Baroda. Food prices in India have recently begun to soften after remaining high for several months, leading to rate cuts after a prolonged pause. GDP in Asia's third largest economy has also been supported by accelerating rural consumption recently after hitting a seven-quarter low last year. Any setback to this farm-led recovery could affect overall growth, at a time when urban households have been cutting back and private investment hasn't picked up. Think tanks like Ceew say a range of urgent measures to mitigate the impact of recurrent heatwaves needs to be thought through, including better weather forecasting infrastructure, agriculture insurance and evolving cropping calendars with climate models to reduce risks and improve yields. As a primarily agrarian country, India is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Ceew estimates three out of every four Indian districts are ""extreme event hotspots"" and 40% exhibit what is called ""a swapping trend"" - which means traditionally flood-prone areas are witnessing more frequent and intense droughts and vice-versa. The country is expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress by 2030, according to one estimate. Climate Transparency, the advocacy group, had pegged India's potential income loss across services, manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors from labour capacity reduction due to extreme heat at $159bn in 2021- or 5.4% of its GDP. Without urgent action, India risks a future where heatwaves threaten both lives and economic stability. Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,XandFacebook.

Los Angeles prosecutor opposes  move to free Menendez brothers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5d9jyxwyo,"The Los Angeles District Attorney has announced his opposition to the resentencing of the notorious Menendez brothers, a move that could have paved the way for their freedom. District Attorney Nathan Hochman's decision marks a departure from his predecessor who had sought to have the brothers resentenced and considered for parole. Both brothers are serving life sentences. Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have long maintained that the murders were driven by years of sexual and physical abuse, rather than financial gain. Hochman argued that the brothers' claims of self-defence was part of a litany of ""lies"". A California judge is set to consider the option of resentencing the brothers on 20 and 21 March. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Hochman outlined much of the criminal case, the defences the brothers had taken and the alleged lies he said they continued to stand by. He said the brothers had not demonstrated true accountability, citing their continued insistence that the killings were an act of self-defence because they believed their parents were planning to kill them. ""They have not shown full insight into their crimes,"" Hochman said, adding that their self-defence claim was ""fabricated."" Hochman's predecessor, George Gascón, had pushed to reduce the Menendez brothers' sentences to 50 years to life, which would have made them immediately eligible for parole. On Monday, newly elected District Attorney Hochman moved to rescind that request, arguing the brothers' meticulously planned the murders and attempted to cover up the crime. In his court filing, Hochman presented detailed evidence of the brothers' planning of the murders, contrasting sharply with Gascón's stance. Gascón, known for his progressive approach to criminal justice, had argued the brothers had been rehabilitated during their three decades behind bars—earning college degrees and establishing prison programs to aid fellow inmates. Hochman suggested the brothers' resentencing request could only be reconsidered if they fully admitted to fabricating their self-defence claims. He said the Menendez brothers had ""acknowledged"" only four of 20 alleged lies they told about the case. He emphasised how they repeatedly changed their account of events—initially denying involvement and suggesting their parents were victims of a Mafia hit. The truth about their culpability emerged after Erik Menendez confessed to his therapist, whose recorded session was later handed over to law enforcement. ""They convinced, not just the media, not just the police, but their family and their friends that they were 100% innocent of these crimes, until eventually these tapes came out,"" Hochman said. The resentencing bid is one ofthree avenues the Menendez brothers have been working on in hopes of gaining their freedom. They've asked for a new trial but Hochman has said his office will oppose the request. The brothers have also asked California Governor Gavin Newsom for clemency, which could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon. Newsom has ordered the parole board to conduct a risk assessment to examine whether the brothers are a danger to society - one step in a broader process that could lead to pardon. Much of theMenendez family has been pushing for the brothers to be released, holding news conferences, appearing at court hearings and meeting with prosecutors in the case. But after meeting Hochman about the case, one family member accused the new district attorney of  a ""hostile, dismissive and patronizing tone"" in a complaint filed with the state's department of corrections and rehabilitation, US media reported. Tamara Goodell, a cousin of the brothers, said in the complaint that Hochman violated her rights as a victim and accused him of having a bias against Erik and Lyle Menendez. At least one member of the family has publicly come out against the bids for their freedom. A lawyer for Kitty Menendez's brother, Milton Andersen, has called the killings ""cold-blooded"" and said the murders ""shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades."" Mr Andersen has said he believes his nephews should stay in prison for their ""heinous act"", said the lawyer, Kathy Cady. Nate Vance said his cousin and Trump were acting like 'useful idiots' to Putin US officials accused Mahmoud Khalil of activities ""aligned to Hamas"" but his lawyer said the government was attacking free speech.
